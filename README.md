# gitops_deploy
Tools

* Using rancher fleet as continous deployment
* Using gitlab for CI (gitlab-ci)
* Using kustomize for changing the manifests

* This assumes that tenant-service-impl & tenant-service-api where the code or changes are often made by developers
* Manifests folder is where it writes the newly generated kubernetes manifests.
* I purposely deleted the settings.xml file as it has hard coded info for authenticating to jfrog repo
